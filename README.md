Before:
The original landing page had a cluttered layout, inconsistent typography, poor color contrast, and lacked clear call-to-actions (CTAs), making navigation confusing and the user experience dull.

After:
The redesigned version improves usability and aesthetics by:

Using a clean grid layout for better content flow

Enhancing visual hierarchy with bold headings and consistent fonts

Applying a modern color palette with better contrast

Adding prominent CTAs and intuitive icons for faster navigation

Ensuring mobile responsiveness for all screen sizes
